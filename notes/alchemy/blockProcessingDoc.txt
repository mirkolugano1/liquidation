Sync of data from webhooks
Scenario 1: Fresh start of express server
syncInMemoryData should not be called, nor should event blocks be saved for later processing

Scenario 2: Data is not synced yet for the first time, but updateUserReserves is in progress
syncInMemoryData should still not be called, event blocks should be saved for later processing at 
the end of the updateUserReserves routine.
When processing the saved event blocks, it should be checked if the single block should be applied 
(aka should sync the in memory data) by checking the block timestamp (evtl add timestamp myself) and 
comparing this timestamp with the corresponding entry in the usersreserves table “modifiedOn” column. 
If the modifiedOn column is older than the block being processed, block should sync in memory data, 
otherwise it can be ignored since the data in the db is already uptodate. 

Scenario 3: Data has already been synced before, but updateUserReserves is in progress
data should be synced while the data is being fetched from chain and written to DB.
When calling refresh method, thus webserver updating local data from the DB, syncing should be 
paused and block saved in temporaryBlocks array. Once fetching data is done, temporaryBlocks should be 
applied, always considering modifiedOn timestamp (same as scenario 2)
